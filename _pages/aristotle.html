    <h1>Aristotle</h1>
    <p>Aristotle was a Greek philosopher and polymath during the Classical period in Ancient Greece. Taught by Plato, he
        was the founder of the Lyceum, the Peripatetic school of philosophy, and the Aristotelian tradition. His
        writings cover many subjects including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics,
        poetry, theatre, music, rhetoric, psychology, linguistics, economics, politics, and government.</p>
    <p>Aristotle provided a complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him. It was above all from
        his teachings that the West inherited its intellectual lexicon, as well as problems and methods of inquiry. As a
        result, his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of knowledge in the West and it
        continues to be a subject of contemporary philosophical discussion.</p>
    <p>Aristotle was born in 384 BC in Stagira, Chalcidice, Greece. He died in 322 BC in Euboea, Greece.</p>
