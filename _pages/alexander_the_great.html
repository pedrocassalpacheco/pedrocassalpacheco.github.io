    <h1>Alexander the Great</h1>
    <p>Alexander III of Macedon, commonly known as Alexander the Great, was a king of the ancient Greek kingdom of
        Macedon and a member of the Argead dynasty. He was born in Pella in 356 BC and succeeded his father Philip II to
        the throne at the age of 20. He spent most of his ruling years on an unprecedented military campaign through
        Asia and northeast Africa, and by the age of 30, he had created one of the largest empires of the ancient world,
        stretching from Greece to northwestern India.</p>
    <p>Alexander was undefeated in battle and is widely considered one of history's most successful military commanders.
        His campaigns greatly increased the cultural interactions and exchanges between the East and West, leading to
        the Hellenistic period.</p>
    <p>Alexander was born on 20 July 356 BC in Pella, Macedon. He died on 10/11 June 323 BC in the Palace of
        Nebuchadnezzar II, Babylon, Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq).</p>
