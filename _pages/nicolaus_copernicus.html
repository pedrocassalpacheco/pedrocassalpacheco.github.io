    <h1>Nicolaus Copernicus</h1>
    <p>Nicolaus Copernicus was a Renaissance-era mathematician and astronomer who formulated a model of the universe
        that placed the Sun rather than Earth at its center. This heliocentric model was a major milestone in the
        history of science and marked the beginning of the Copernican Revolution.</p>
    <p>Copernicus's work "De revolutionibus orbium coelestium" (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres), published
        just before his death in 1543, is considered one of the most important works in the history of Western science.
        It challenged the geocentric model that had dominated for centuries and laid the groundwork for future
        astronomers like Galileo and Kepler.</p>
    <p>Nicolaus Copernicus was born on 19 February 1473 in Toru≈Ñ, Poland. He died on 24 May 1543 in Frombork, Poland.
