    <h1>Raphael</h1>
    <p>Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino, known as Raphael, was an Italian painter and architect of the High Renaissance. His
        work is admired for its clarity of form, ease of composition, and visual achievement of the Neoplatonic ideal of
        human grandeur. Together with Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, he forms the traditional trinity of great
        masters of that period.</p>
    <p>Raphael is best known for his Madonnas and for his large figure compositions in the Vatican. His frescoes in the
        Raphael Rooms of the Vatican Palace are considered one of the pinnacles of Renaissance art.</p>
    <p>Raphael was born on 6 April 1483 in Urbino, Duchy of Urbino (present-day Italy). He died on 6 April 1520 in Rome,
        Papal States (present-day Italy).</p>
