    <h1>Thomas Huxley</h1>
    <p>Thomas Henry Huxley was an English biologist and anthropologist specializing in comparative anatomy. He is known
        as "Darwin's Bulldog" for his advocacy of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. Huxley's vigorous defense of
        evolutionary theory earned him the nickname.</p>
    <p>Huxley was instrumental in developing scientific education in Britain and was a founding member of the X Club, a
        group of scientists dedicated to promoting science and scientific thinking. He also coined the term "agnostic"
        to describe his philosophical position on the existence of God.</p>
    <p>Thomas Huxley was born on 4 May 1825 in Ealing, Middlesex, England. He died on 29 June 1895 in Eastbourne,
        Sussex, England.</p>
