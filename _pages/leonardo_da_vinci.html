    <h1>Leonardo da Vinci</h1>
    <p>Leonardo da Vinci was an Italian polymath of the Renaissance whose areas of interest included invention, drawing,
        painting, sculpture, architecture, science, music, mathematics, engineering, literature, anatomy, geology,
        astronomy, botany, paleontology, and cartography.</p>
    <p>He is widely considered one of the greatest painters of all time, despite fewer than 25 of his paintings having
        survived. His most famous works include the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper. Leonardo's notebooks, which contain
        drawings, scientific diagrams, and his thoughts on various subjects, are also highly regarded.</p>
    <p>Leonardo was born on 15 April 1452 in Vinci, Republic of Florence (present-day Italy). He died on 2 May 1519 in
        Amboise, Kingdom of France.</p>
