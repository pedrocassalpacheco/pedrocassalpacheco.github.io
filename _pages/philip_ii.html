    <h1>Philip II of Macedon</h1>
    <p>Philip II of Macedon was the king of the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon from 359 BC until his assassination in
        336 BC. He was a member of the Argead dynasty and the father of Alexander the Great.</p>
    <p>Philip II is credited with transforming Macedon into a powerful military state. He reformed the Macedonian army,
        introducing the phalanx infantry corps, and expanded his kingdom through both diplomacy and military conquest.
        His reign laid the groundwork for the future conquests of his son, Alexander the Great.</p>
    <p>Philip II was born in 382 BC in Pella, Macedon. He was assassinated in 336 BC in Aegae, Macedon.</p>
