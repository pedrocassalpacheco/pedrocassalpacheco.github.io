    <h1>Isaac Newton</h1>
    <p>Sir Isaac Newton was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, and author who is widely recognised as one
        of the most influential scientists of all time and a key figure in the scientific revolution.</p>
    <p>His book "Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica" (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first
        published in 1687, laid the foundations of classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributions to optics
        and shares credit with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing the infinitesimal calculus.</p>
    <p>Newton was born on 25 December 1642 in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England. He died on 20 March 1726/27 in
        Kensington, Middlesex, England.</p>
