    <h1>Charles Babbage</h1>
    <p>Charles Babbage was an English polymath. A mathematician, philosopher, inventor, and mechanical engineer, Babbage
        originated the concept of a digital programmable computer. He is considered by some to be "the father of the
        computer".</p>
    <p>Babbage is credited with inventing the first mechanical computer that eventually led to more complex designs. His
        Analytical Engine, although never completed, is considered a precursor to modern computers.</p>
    <p>Charles Babbage was born on 26 December 1791 in London, England. He died on 18 October 1871 in London, England.
